The following Terms & Conditions were based on the GNU Public License (Version 3, 29 June 2007 - Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < http://fsf.org/>), but were written in order to regulate the licensing of the present code by Pubmobile.

Terms & Conditions
Definitions
“Copyright”: means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program”: refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.
“Modify the Work”:  means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
“Covered Work”: means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
“Propagate the Work”: means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
“Convey the Work”: means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
“Entity Transaction”: means a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.
“Source Code”: means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
Basic Permissions
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of Copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a Covered Work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a Covered Work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by Copyright law.
You may make, run and Propagate Covered Works that you do not Convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may Convey Covered Works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control Copyright. Those thus making or running the Covered Works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your Copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 7 makes it unnecessary.
You shall not, by no means, use the Program for commercial purposes if you offer the same service(s) or product(s) as Pubmobile or Revmob and/or is regarded as an ad network, otherwise Pubmobile may charge you for losses and damages (this statement represents an exception to Section 10).
Conveying Verbatim Copies
You may Convey verbatim copies of the Program's Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge no price for each copy that you Convey, and you may not offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
Conveying Modified Source Versions
You may Convey a Work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of Source Code, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License.
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way.
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive user interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
If you compete against Pubmobile in any kind of market and/or is regarded as an ad network, you must explicitly state that you are using the Program of a competitor by pasting the following text in all the interfaces available to the users or consumers of your services or products:
“We run our business by using the technology developed by Revmob, our competitor”
If you do not respect the obligation as mentioned above, you hereby grant Pubmobile the right to use your name in its website in order to show to its customers and visitors that you are using a technology developed by Pubmobile or Revmob.
A compilation of a Covered Work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a Covered Work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
 Termination.
You may not Propagate or modify a Covered Work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to Propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a Covered Work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to Propagate or modify any Covered Work. These actions infringe Copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a Covered Work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you Convey a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, Modify and Propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
If propagation of a Covered Work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot Convey a Covered Work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not Convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further Conveying from those to whom you Convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from Conveying the Program.
Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
